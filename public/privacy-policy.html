    <h1>Privacy Policy for Wallet+</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 6, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Wallet+ ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Wallet+ handles your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> Wallet+ is a completely offline application that stores all your financial data locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial transactions and records</li>
        <li>Budget information</li>
        <li>Financial goals and preferences</li>
        <li>Account details (stored only on your device)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your data is stored exclusively on your device using browser local storage. Your data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device-Only Storage</strong> - All data stored in browser localStorage</li>
        <li><strong>Local Only</strong> - Never transmitted to any servers</li>
        <li><strong>Private</strong> - Only accessible on your device and browser</li>
        <li><strong>Portable</strong> - You can export and backup your data anytime</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Security Note:</strong> Since this is an offline app with no user authentication, your data security depends on your device security. We recommend using device-level security features (screen lock, biometrics) to protect your financial information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information</li>
        <li>Email addresses</li>
        <li>Phone numbers</li>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
        <li>Any third-party tracking data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Wallet+ does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools. We do not share your data with anyone because we never have access to it.</p>

    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Wallet+ does not use cookies for tracking. We only use local storage for saving your financial data on your device.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement security best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data</li>
        <li>No server-side storage or transmission</li>
        <li>Browser's built-in localStorage security</li>
        <li>Open-source codebase for transparency</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your data's security ultimately depends on your device security. We strongly recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using a secure device password/PIN</li>
        <li>Keeping your device and browser updated</li>
        <li>Not sharing your device with untrusted users</li>
        <li>Regularly backing up your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Wallet+ does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is transmitted or collected, COPPA requirements are not applicable.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access all your data within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Export your data anytime using the backup feature</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Clear all data using the reset function</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> Complete ownership of your financial information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. We have no access to your data and cannot delete it for you.</p>

    <h2>11. International Users</h2>
    <p>Wallet+ works entirely offline. Your data never leaves your device, so international data transfer laws do not apply.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on this page.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through the app's feedback feature.</p>

    <h2>14. Consent</h2>
    <p>By using Wallet+, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.</p>
